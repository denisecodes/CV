## Denise Chan


Having a curious mind and a passion for learning, I enrolled myself in two coding courses with Code First Girls (SQL and Python) - where I found myself enjoying coding and my new found passion for tech. Currently a student at Makers completing the Devops stream, expected to graduate end of October.

A former Tech Recruiter looking to kickstart my career in Software Engineering. I have three years of professional experience in the HR/Recruitment, sourcing and managing candidates for tech roles where I was first exposed to the world of coding and tech concepts.
