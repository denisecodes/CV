## Denise Chan


Having a curious mind and a passion for learning, I enrolled myself in two coding courses with Code First Girls (SQL and Python) - where I found myself enjoying coding and my new found passion for tech. Currently a student at Makers completing the Devops stream, expected to graduate end of October.

A former Tech Recruiter looking to kickstart my career in Software Engineering. I have three years of professional experience in the HR/Recruitment, sourcing and managing candidates for tech roles where I was first exposed to the world of coding and tech concepts.

<!-- Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.) -->

- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication. -->
